# Global Guidelines

Never use absolute paths in committed documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, docs/, comments). Use relative paths for files within the project and generic descriptions for external references (e.g. "the BGA extension repo" not `D:\projects\bga\assistant`). Absolute paths are machine-specific and break for other contributors.

Always ask clarifying questions before implementing if anything is ambiguous or unclear.

## Self-Sufficiency

Before asking the user to do something (run a command, edit a file, check a value), figure out how to do it yourself. If the action is non-destructive, just do it. If it's destructive or irreversible, ask the user for permission — but propose the concrete action, don't ask the user to perform it.

When changes are ready to test, run the project's `deploy` command (or equivalent) yourself via Bash. Do not suggest the user "run `deploy`" or type `! deploy`. The Self-Sufficiency rule applies: invoke the action, don't outsource it.

Exclude `node_modules/` from all file and content search patterns — it clogs results with false positives.

Do not inline Python scripts into Bash commands via `python -c`. Instead, use a heredoc: `python <<'EOF' ... EOF`.

Do not add logic, data structures, classes, or exports to production code that exist only to support tests. Tests should exercise the public API and real behavior — not rely on test-only hooks, flags, exports, or types in production modules.

## Git Workflow

- Do not create git commits unless explicitly asked
- Do not push to remote unless explicitly requested
- Follow `~/.claude/skills/shared/commit-message-rules.md`
- Prefer `git status --short` over `git diff --stat` for change-set summaries. Changes sit unstaged until `/commit` runs, so untracked files are part of the pending commit — and `git diff --stat` silently omits them, producing an incomplete picture.

## Bash Commands

- **Windows (Git Bash):** always use forward slashes (`/`) in paths, not backslashes (`\`). Backslashes are interpreted as escape characters by bash and get stripped.
- **macOS / Linux:** paths are already Unix-style; no special handling needed.

When asking the user to run a command manually (e.g. launching an app, system config):
- **on Windows:** provide PowerShell syntax — not bash or cmd.
- **on macOS / Linux:** provide bash/zsh syntax.

## Tooling Defaults

- **Node.js**: default to the current active LTS (Node **24** as of May 2026) for new projects, CI workflows, and `.nvmrc` files — unless the project already pins an older version, a dependency demands otherwise, or there's a specific reason to use something else. Always prefer an existing `.nvmrc` / `engines.node` over this default.

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Leave an empty line at the end of every file
- Prefer single-line expressions over multi-line formatting, even if they're long. **Exception**: multi-line is acceptable when calling functions/constructors with all named parameters.

### UI Text Casing

Default to sentence case for user-facing UI strings (menu items, buttons, dialog titles, tooltips, notifications). Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns/acronyms. Examples: "Open config file", "Hide with Esc", "Start with Windows". See `~/.claude/memory/feedback_sentence_case_ui.md` for rationale and edge cases.

### Prose Style

In prose (docs, READMEs, comments), don't open a sentence or line with code-formatted (backtick-wrapped) text when regular text follows — lead with a real word and fold the code reference in after it ("The `notifications` block controls…" not "`notifications` controls…"). Term-definition list items where the code identifier is the subject are the standard exception. See `~/.claude/memory/feedback_no_code_at_sentence_start.md`.

Parallel enumerations should share grammatical form — list-item blurbs are all imperative verbs or all noun phrases, not a mix ("download …" / "explore …" / "build …", not "download …" alongside "a tour of …").

### Explicit State

Use a dedicated field or variable for object state rather than overloading another field's values (e.g., using `internalDate === 0` as a "deleted" sentinel). A simple null/non-null check is fine, but anything beyond that should be an explicit status field.

### Early Returns

Avoid adding early return guards like `if not items: return` when the function would behave identically without them (e.g., a `for` loop over an empty collection naturally does nothing). Only add early returns when they actually change behavior or prevent errors.

### Type Hints (Python)

Always specify parameter and return types.

### Import Organization

Place imports at the top of the file. Order (with blank lines between groups):
1. Standard library
2. Third-party
3. Local

Inline imports only for circular import resolution (add comment: `# inline to avoid circular import`) or `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks.

### Dependencies (Python)

When adding or removing a third-party import, update `requirements.txt` in the same change to keep it in sync.

### Refactoring Safety

When changing field/function names, search all usages (including tests) and update accordingly before making breaking changes. Run all tests after refactoring.

## Gitignore

When adding entries to `.gitignore`, choose the right scope:
- **Global gitignore** (`~/.gitignore_global`): OS-specific or user-specific files — IDE folders, OS thumbnail caches, tool outputs for tools the user happens to use (e.g. `.idea/`, `Thumbs.db`, `.ralphex/`).
- **Project gitignore** (`.gitignore`): files that everyone who checks out the project should ignore — build outputs, `.env` files, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`.

## Symlinks

Everything under `~/.claude/` is symlinked from the dotfiles repo (`CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `learnings/`, `memory/`, `scripts/`). The Write and Edit tools **refuse to write through symlinks**. Before editing any file under `~/.claude/`, resolve the symlink with `readlink <path>` and pass the real target path to Write/Edit.

For first-time global installation, use the platform-appropriate command block from `README.md`'s Global Installation section. For ad-hoc symlinks during a session:

- **macOS / Linux:** `ln -s` with an absolute target path (`"$(pwd)/..."`).
- **Windows:** Never create symlinks from Bash (`ln -s`) — it silently creates copies instead. Use PowerShell `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink` from an Administrator prompt. Use `$PWD` to build absolute target paths.

## Global Memory

Cross-project preferences and feedback. Memory files live in `~/.claude/memory/`. When saving a memory that applies across all projects (not just the current one), write the file there and add an index entry below. Same frontmatter format as project-specific memories.

**Project memory is version-controlled too.** Repos wired with `~/.claude/scripts/link-project-memory.sh` redirect their machine-local memory cache (`~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/`, a symlink) into a committed `<repo>/.claude/memory/`. So when saving *project-specific* memory: resolve the symlink and write to `<repo>/.claude/memory/`, then commit it with the rest of the work. On a fresh clone, re-run the script to re-establish the symlink. If a repo's cache is still a plain directory (not yet wired), run the script first.

## Reference Material

Before reinventing a plugin or skill, and whenever you feel under-informed about the technology or domain at hand, consult the official Anthropic repositories:
- Plugins: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official
- Skills: https://github.com/anthropics/skills

Browse them for existing implementations to reuse, adapt, or learn from rather than building from scratch.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` (project-local) or `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` (global). The entry point for each skill is `SKILL.md`.
